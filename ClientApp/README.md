![alt tag](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5kawW6byJVc/UyH-TESXArI/AAAAAAAAAao/GNq7zO56BJg/s1600/Jquery.jpg)

The project provides a working Spring MVC REST application. The interface/exchange mechanism used is application/xml

The application also provides a login screen from which a REST request is generated by using Jquery ajax.

The same XML REST service can be tested using Chrome based REST API. For more information about the project refer below link.
